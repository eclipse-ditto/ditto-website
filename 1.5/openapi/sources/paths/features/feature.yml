    Create or modify a specific feature identified by the `featureId` path
    parameter of the thing identified by the `thingId` path parameter.

    ### Create feature
    If the feature ID is new, the feature and all content from the JSON body will be created

    ### Update feature
    If the feature ID is used already in this thing, the feature will be overwrittern
    with the content from the JSON body.

    Example: Set the `featureId` to **coffee-brewer** and all properties in the body part.

    ```
    {
      "definition": ["com.acme:coffeebrewer:0.1.0"],
      "properties": {
        "brewed-coffees": 42
      }
    }
