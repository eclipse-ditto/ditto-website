  summary: Activate subjects for this policy derived from the token
  description: |-
    **This action only works when authenticated with a Json Web Token (JWT).**

    Based on the authenticated token (JWT), **for each policy entry** matching those conditions:
    * the authenticated token is granted the `EXECUTE` permission to perform the `activateTokenIntegration` action
    * one of the subject IDs is contained in the authenticated token
    * at least one `READ` permission to a `thing:/` resource path is granted

    a new subject is **injected into the matched policy entry** calculated with information extracted from the
    authenticated JWT.

    The injected subjects expire when the JWT expires.
