  summary: Activate a subject for this policy entry derived from the token
  description: |-
    **This action only works when authenticated with a Json Web Token (JWT).**

    Based on the authenticated token (JWT), **this policy entry** is checked to match those conditions:
    * the authenticated token is granted the `EXECUTE` permission to perform the `activateTokenIntegration` action
    * one of the subject IDs is contained in the authenticated token
    * at least one `READ` permission to a `thing:/` resource path is granted

    When all conditions match, a new subject is **injected into this policy entry** calculated with information
    extracted from the authenticated JWT.

    The injected subjects expire when the JWT expires.
