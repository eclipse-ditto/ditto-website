  Possible values for the parameter:
  
  #### Sort operations
  
  * ```sort([+|-]{property})```
  * ```sort([+|-]{property},[+|-]{property},...)```
  
  #### Paging operations
  
  * ```size({page-size})```  Maximum allowed page size is `200`. Default page size is `25`.
  * ```cursor({cursor-id})```  Start the search from the cursor location. Specify the cursor ID without
  quotation marks. Cursor IDs are given in search responses and mark the position after the last entry of
  the previous search. The meaning of cursor IDs is unspecified and may change without notice.
  
  The paging option `limit({offset},{count})` is deprecated.
  It may result in slow queries or timeouts and will be removed eventually.
  
  #### Examples:
  
  * ```sort(+thingId)```
  * ```sort(-attributes/manufacturer)```
  * ```sort(+thingId,-attributes/manufacturer)```
  * ```size(10)``` return 10 results
  * ```cursor(LOREMIPSUM)```  return results after the position of the cursor `LOREMIPSUM`.
  
  #### Combine:
  
  If you need to specify multiple options, when using the swagger UI just write each option in a new line.
  When using the plain REST API programmatically,
  you will need to separate the options using a comma (,) character.
  
  ```size(200),cursor(LOREMIPSUM)```
  
  The deprecated paging option `limit` may not be combined with the other paging options `size` and `cursor`.
