  summary: Deactivate a subject for this policy entry derived from the token
  description: |-
    **This action only works when authenticated with a Json Web Token (JWT).**

    * the authenticated token is granted the `EXECUTE` permission to perform the `deactivateTokenIntegration` action
    * one of the subject IDs is contained in the authenticated token

    When all conditions match, the calculated subject with information extracted from the authenticated JWT is **removed
    from this policy entry**.
